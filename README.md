# README.md

This repository is dedicated to a programming exercise which aimed to copy the Spotify Web Player Interface **with no comertial purpose**. This means that the only purpose for the code shown here was **learning**.


# Files

This webpage was built using HTML/CSS and just a tiny bit of Javascript (in order to use "Scroll" as a parameter for the header background). The CSS file is on "css" folder and the needed pictures are on "img" folder. Icons from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/) were also used.

# Prints

The following pictures are screeshots taken during *final testing* phase of this project.
